## whats next

would love feedback from the community - this doesn't conform to the standards and it will need to

more feedback from the 'desktop miners' about what txs in progress and what errors they have

ENS on everything just like in the universal login demo
  - instead of passing around accounts it should be yourname.metatxr.eth

this still requires frontends to change, I would like to hijack the .send function in web3
  then detect if they are logged into a metatx account or not and send the given tx as meta
    OR, work totally normal

find a good method of sharing the open metatxs peer or peer so other desktop miners can participate

clean up auth or maybe even create an allowance system
